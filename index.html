        <h2> Why is the console used?</h2>
        <p>The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
        </p>
        <script>
            var name = "Tansen";
            console.log(name);
            var surname = "Jaradi";
            console.log(surname);
            var a = "10";
            console.log(a);
            var b = "5";
            console.log(b);

            var add = a + b;
            console.log(add);
            var minus= "10" - "5";
